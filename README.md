# ProxyPro
## Created Proxy List With Python
### Use Packege's : random , time , colorama

You have to pay a lot to get a proxy list and the low quality of some service providers has not been good. Now I have written a proprietary program that randomly generates an IP and port and stores it in a text file and stores another blank IP in another text file.

First Follow This Common On The CMD Or Terminal :

pip install colorama

```
